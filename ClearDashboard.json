When there is an alignment between a source composite token and a target token in another verse, highlighting the tokens only works if you shift-hover over the target token in the other verse. To create an alignment, click on the source token (composite or regular), then shift-click on the target token. You will need to shift-hover to see the newly added alignment. To delete an alignment, shift hover to find the alignment. You can delete the alignment form either the source or target token.",
